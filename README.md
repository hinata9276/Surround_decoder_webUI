# Surround_decoder_webUI
A surround decoder with web UI utilising Python Flask and Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi will interface with the TDA7439 and custom designed Dolby processor(obsoleted chip bought from Ebay) to process the audio into 4.1 Channel surround sound (Left, Centre, Right, Rear, Subwoofer) with custom guitar delay chip to delay real channel signal to widen the field effect.

The demo video can be found here, the video is not made public due to copyright music recording.
